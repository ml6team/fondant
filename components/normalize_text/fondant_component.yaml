  This component implements several text normalization techniques to clean and preprocess textual 
  data:

  - Apply lowercasing: Converts all text to lowercase
  - Remove unnecessary whitespaces: Eliminates extra spaces between words, e.g. tabs
  - Apply NFC normalization: Converts characters to their canonical representation
  - Remove common seen patterns in webpages following the implementation of 
    [Penedo et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01116.pdf)
  - Remove punctuation: Strips punctuation marks from the text
  
  These text normalization techniques are valuable for preparing text data before using it for
  the training of large language models.
