description: |
  This component crops out image borders. This is typically useful when working with graphical 
  images that have single-color borders (e.g. logos, icons, etc.).
  
  The component takes an image and calculates which color is most present in the border. It then 
  crops the image in order to minimize this single-color border. The `padding` argument will add 
  extra border to the image before cropping it, in order to avoid cutting off parts of the image.
  The resulting crop will always be square. If a crop is not possible, the component will return 
  the original image.
  
  #### Examples
