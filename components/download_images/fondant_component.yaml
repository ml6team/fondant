name: Download images
description: |
  Component that downloads images from a list of URLs.
  
  This component takes in image URLs as input and downloads the images, along with some metadata 
  (like their height and width). The images are stored in a new colum as bytes objects. This 
  component also resizes the images using the 
  [resizer](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset/blob/main/img2dataset/resizer.py) function 
  from the img2dataset library.
