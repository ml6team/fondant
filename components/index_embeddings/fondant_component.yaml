      data:
        type: string
      embedding:
        type: array

args:
  weaviate_url:
    description: The URL of the weaviate instance.
    type: str
    default: http://localhost:8080
  model:
    description: |
      A name for the model used to generate the embeddings.
      It is used to name the weaviate class and thus has to follow the naming conventions of weaviate.
    type: str
    default: MiniLM
  dataset:
    description: |
      The name of the data source from which the text snippets that were used to generate the embeddings stem.
      It is used to name the weaviate class and thus has to follow the naming conventions of weaviate.
    type: str
  vectorizer:
    description: |
      The configuration of the weaviate vectorizer (for vectorization with text2vec-* modules) in the class object 
      corresponding to the model used to generate the embeddings. 
      You can find the available modules in the weaviate documentation: https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules. 
      This can be used for smoother interaction with the weaviate instance after indexing e.g. using langchain similarity search. 
      The module used also has to be enabled in your weaviate instance deployment. 
      Can also be {"vectorizer": "none"} if you do not want to make use of this feature.

  overwrite:
    description: Whether to overwrite/ re-create the existing weaviate class and its embeddings.
    type: bool
    default: 0
