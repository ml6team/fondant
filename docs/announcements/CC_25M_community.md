# 25 million Creative Commons image dataset released

[Fondant](https://fondant.ai) is an open-source project that aims to simplify and speed up 
large-scale data processing by making containerized components reusable across pipelines & 
execution environments, shared within the community.

A current challenge for generative AI is compliance with copyright laws. For this reason, 
Fondant has developed a data-processing pipeline to create a 500-million dataset of Creative 
Commons images to train a latent diffusion image generation model that respects copyright. Today,
as a first step, we are releasing a 25-million sample dataset and invite the open source 
community to collaborate on further refinement steps.

Fondant offers tools to download, explore and process the data. The current example pipeline 
includes a component for downloading the urls, a simple file type filter, one for downloading 
the images and one for deduplicating the urls. Additional processing components which could be 
contributed include, in order of priority:

* Image-based deduplication
* Visual quality / aesthetic quality estimation
* Watermark detection
* Not safe for work (NSFW) content detection
* Face detection
* Personal Identifiable Information (PII) detection
* Text detection
* AI generated image detection
* Any components that you propose to develop

The Fondant team also invites contributors to the core framework and is looking for feedback on 
the frameworkâ€™s usability and for suggestions for improvement. Contact us at
