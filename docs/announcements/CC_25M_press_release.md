# 25 million Creative Commons image dataset released

> Fondant is an open-source project that aims to enable compliant, large-scale processing in a
> simple and cost-efficient way. As a first step, we have developed a pipeline to create a  Creative Commons image dataset and are releasing a first 25 million sample with a call to action to help develop additional data processing pipelines.

[Fondant](https://fondant.ai) simplifies and speeds up large-scale data processing by making
self-contained pipeline components reusable across pipelines, infrastructures and shareable
within the community. By offering a library of ready-to-use, off-the-shelf components and a
standardized way of building and combining them with custom components, it significantly reduces
the time required to build and maintain data processing infrastructure for generative AI
applications in production.

Supported by [Flanders innovation & entrepreneurship](https://vlaio.be) and European AI Service
Provider [ML6](https://ml6.eu), Fondant developed a pipeline to create a
[dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fondantai/fondant-cc-25m) of over 500 million Creative
Commons-licensed images from Common Crawl to train an image-generation model that respects
copyright. Now we are releasing a first 25 million sample dataset with tools to download,
explore and process the data. We are inviting developers and data enthusiasts to collaborate on
large-scale data processing pipelines by building custom components for advanced filtering and
captioning and to contribute to the core framework. We are also looking for feedback on the
framework’s usability with suggestions for improvement. Contact us at
[info@fondant.ai](mailto:info@fondant.ai) and/or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/HnTdWhydGp)
to help realize this vision.
