# Components

Fondant makes it easy to build data preparation pipelines leveraging reusable components. Fondant
provides a lot of components out of the box
([overview](https://fondant.ai/en/latest/components/hub/)), but you can also define your
own custom components.

## The anatomy of a component

A component is completely defined by its script, specification, docker image, which data it consumes and produces, and which arguments it takes.
The definition of the script is similar for all types of components. All other aspects of the component are defined 
different ways, depending on the type of component. Continue reading to learn more about the different types of components
and how to define them.

## Component script

The logic should be implemented as a class, inheriting from one of the base `Component` classes
offered by Fondant.
There are three large types of components:

- **`LoadComponent`**: Load data into your pipeline from an external data source
- **`TransformComponent`**: Implement a single transformation step in your pipeline
- **`WriteComponent`**: Write the results of your pipeline to an external data sink

The easiest way to implement a `TransformComponent` is to subclass the provided
`PandasTransformComponent`. This component streams your data and offers it in memory-sized
chunks as pandas dataframes.

```python
import pandas as pd
from fondant.component import PandasTransformComponent


class ExampleComponent(PandasTransformComponent):

    def __init__(self, *, argument1, argument2) -> None:
        """
        Args:
            argumentX: An argument passed to the component
        """
        # Initialize your component here based on the arguments

    def transform(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Implement your custom logic in this single method
        Args:
            dataframe: A Pandas dataframe containing one partition of your data
        Returns:
            A pandas dataframe containing the transformed data
        """
```

The `__init__` method is called once for each component class with custom arguments defined in the
`args` section of the component. This is a good
place to initialize resources and costly initializations such as network connections, models,
parsing a config file, etc. By doing so, you can effectively prevent the redundant re-initialization
of resources each time the `transform` method is invoked.

The `transform` method is called multiple times, each time containing a pandas `dataframe`
with a partition of your data loaded in memory.

The `dataframes` passed to the `transform` method contains the data specified in the `consumes`
section of the component. If a component defines that it consumes an `image` field, 
this data can be accessed using `dataframe["image"]`.

The `transform` method should return a single dataframe, with the columns complying to the
schema defined by the `produces` section of the component specification.

### Configuring Dask

You can configure the [Dask client](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/scheduling.html) based on the 
needs of your component by overriding the `dask_client` method:

```python
import os

from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster
from fondant.component import PandasTransformComponent

class Component(PandasTransformComponent):
  
    def dask_client(self) -> Client:
        """Initialize the dask client to use for this component."""
        cluster = LocalCluster(
            processes=True,
            n_workers=os.cpu_count(),
            threads_per_worker=1,
        )
        return Client(cluster)
```

The default configuration uses a `LocalCluster` which works with processes, the same amount of 
workers as logical CPUs available, and one thread per worker.

Some components might work more optimally using threads or a different combination of threads 
and processes. To use multiple GPUs, you can use a 
[`LocalCUDACluster`](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cuda/stable/quickstart/#localcudacluster). 

## Component types

We can distinguish two different types of components:

- **Custom components** are completely defined and implemented by the user. There are two ways to 
  define a custom component:
    - **Lightweight Components**: Create a component from a self-contained Python function.
    This is the easiest way to create a custom component. It allows you to define a component without
    having to build a custom docker image or defining a component specification.
    - **Containerized Components**: You can build your code into a docker image
     and write an accompanying component specification that refers to it. This is used for 
    more complex components that require additional dependencies (e.g. GPU support). 

- **Reusable components** can be used out of the box and can be loaded from the Fondant Hub. They are containerized components that are defined by the Fondant team or
  the community.

  
### Custom components


#### Lightweight Components
To define a lightweight component, you can create a self-contained python function that
implements the logic of your component.


```python
from fondant.component import PandasTransformComponent
from fondant.pipeline import  lightweight_component
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa

@lightweight_component
class AddNumber(PandasTransformComponent):
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.n = n

    def transform(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        dataframe["x"] = dataframe["x"].map(lambda x: x + self.n)
        return dataframe
```

You can add a custom component to your pipeline by passing in the reference to the component class containing 
your script. 

```python title="pipeline.py"
_ = dataset.apply(
    ref=AddNumber,
    produces={"x": pa.int32()},
    arguments={
      "n": 1
    },
)
```

See our [best practices on creating a lightweight component](../components/lightweight_components.md).


#### Containerized Components
To define your own containerized component, you can build your code into a docker image and write an 
accompanying component specification that refers to it.

A typical file structure for a custom component looks like this:
```
|- components
|  |- custom_component
|     |- src
|     |  |- main.py
|     |- Dockerfile
|     |- fondant_component.yaml
|     |- requirements.txt
|- pipeline.py
```

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the code into a docker image, which is then referred to in the 
`fondant_component.yaml`. 

```yaml title="components/custom_component/fondant_component.yaml"
name: Custom component
description: This is a custom component
image: custom_component:latest
```

You can add a custom component to your pipeline by passing in the path to the directory containing 
your `fondant_component.yaml`.

```python title="pipeline.py"

dataset = dataset.apply(
  component_dir="components/custom_component",
  arguments={
    "arg": "value"
  }
)
```

See our [best practices on creating a containerized component](../components/containerized_components.md).


### Reusable components

Reusable components are out of the box containerized components from the Fondant Hub that you can easily add 
to your pipeline:

```python

dataset = dataset.apply(
  "reusable_component",
  arguments={
    "arg": "value"
  }
)
```

You can find an overview of the available reusable components on the
[Fondant hub](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/src/fondant/components). Check their 
documentation for information on which arguments they accept and which data they consume and 
produce.
