# Fondant 0.6 brings Vertex AI support and more

Hi all, we released Fondant 0.6, which brings some major new features and improvements:

🌀 **Vertex AI is now supported as a backend for pipeline execution.**

Simply run fondant run vertex <pipeline.py> to submit your pipeline.
Run fondant run vertex --help to see the possible configuration options.

<!-- more -->

📦 **The reusable components are now available on DockerHub under the fndnt organization.**

DockerHub is supported more broadly than Github container registry which we were using before.

⏩ **Previously executed components are now cached when re-executed with the same arguments.**

This makes it easier to iterate on development of down-stream components
This allows you to resume failed pipelines from their failed step

👷 **Added fondant build command which let's you build fondant components easily**

Run fondant build <component_dir>. Check fondant build -h for options.
The command will also update the image reference in the fondant_component.yaml to the newly built one.

2️⃣ **We migrated from KfP v1 to KfP v2.**

This means:
We now benefit from the latest KfP developments
We compile fondant pipelines to the IR YAML format, which is supported by other execution engines such as Vertex
You need a KfP v2 cluster to run fondant pipelines

📚 **We added an example pipeline and reusable components for RAG indexing**

Have a look at https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/examples/pipelines/rag-cc-pipeline 

🛠️ **Install it now using fondant==0.6.2**

Let us know what you think!
