installed on your system. We only support Docker compose V2 and above. If you have an older version of
Docker compose, please upgrade to the latest version as described in the [Docker compose migration doc](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/).

    - There is no support for `linux/arm64` based images (yet). `linux/amd64` images will be used by default.

    - In Docker Desktop Dashboardsâ€™ `Settings -> Features in development`, make sure to
      uncheck `Use containerid for pulling and storing images`.
