## 🪤 Why Fondant?

With the advent of transfer learning and now foundation models, everyone has started sharing and 
reusing machine learning models. Most of the work now goes into building data processing 
pipelines, which everyone still does from scratch. 
This doesn't need to be the case, though, if processing components would be shareable and pipelines 
composable. Realizing this is the main vision behind Fondant.

Towards that end, Fondant offers:

- 🔧 Plug ‘n’ play composable data processing pipelines
- 🧩 Library containing off-the-shelf reusable components
- 🐼 A simple Pandas based interface for creating custom components
- 📊 Built-in lineage, caching, and data explorer
- 🚀 Production-ready, scalable deployment
- ☁️ Integration with runners across different clouds (Vertex, Sagemaker, Kubeflow)

## 💨 Getting Started

Eager to get started? Follow our [**step by step guide**](https://fondant.ai/en/latest/guides/first_pipeline/) to get your first pipeline up and running.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 🧩 Reusable components

Fondant comes with a library of reusable components that you can leverage to compose your own 
pipeline:

- Data ingestion: _S3, GCS, ABS, Hugging Face, local file system, ..._
- Data Filtering: _Duplicates, language, visual style, topic, format, aesthetics, NSFW, license, 
  ..._
- Data Enrichment: _Captions, segmentations, embeddings, ..._
- Data Transformation: _Image cropping, image resizing, text chunking, ...._
- Data retrieval: _Common Crawl, LAION, ..._

👉 **Check our [Component Hub](https://fondant.ai/en/latest/components/hub/) for an overview of all 
available components**

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 🪄 Example pipelines

We have created several ready-made example pipelines for you to use as a starting point for exploring Fondant. 
They are hosted as separate repositories containing a notebook tutorial so you can easily clone them and get started:

📖 [**RAG tuning pipeline**](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant-usecase-RAG)  
End-to-end Fondant pipelines to index and evaluate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

🛋️ [**ControlNet Interior Design Pipeline**](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant-usecase-controlnet)  
An end-to-end Fondant pipeline to collect and process data for the fine-tuning of a ControlNet model, focusing on images related to interior design.

🖼️ [**Filter creative common license images**](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant-usecase-filter-creative-commons)  
An end-to-end Fondant pipeline that starts from our Fondant-CC-25M creative commons image dataset and filters and downloads the desired images.

## ⚒️ Installation

First, run the minimal Fondant installation:

```
pip install fondant
```

Fondant also includes extra dependencies for specific runners, storage integrations and publishing 
components to registries. 
We can install the local runner to enable local pipeline execution:

```
pip install fondant[docker]
```

For more detailed installation options, check the [**installation page**](https://fondant.ai/en/latest/guides/installation/)on our documentation.


## 👨‍💻 Usage

#### Pipeline

Fondant allows you to easily define data pipelines comprised of both reusable and custom
components. The following pipeline for instance uses the reusable `load_from_hf_hub` component
to load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub and process it using a custom component:

**_pipeline.py_**
```python

from fondant.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline(name="example pipeline", base_path="./data")

dataset = pipeline.read(
    "load_from_hf_hub",
    arguments={
        "dataset_name": "lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions"
    },
)

dataset = dataset.apply(
    "resize_images",
    arguments={
        "resize_width": 128,
        "resize_height": 128,
    },
)
```

Custom use cases require the creation of custom components. Check out our [getting started page](https://fondant.ai/en/latest/guides/first_pipeline/) to learn
more about how to build custom pipelines and components.

### Running your pipeline

Once you have a pipeline you can easily run (and compile) it by using the built-in CLI:

```bash
fondant run local pipeline.py
```

To see all available runner and arguments you can check the fondant CLI help pages

```bash
fondant --help
```

Or for a subcommand:

```bash
fondant <subcommand> --help
```
