**Fondant helps you create high quality datasets to fine-tune foundation models such as:**

- üé® Stable Diffusion  
- üìÑ GPT-like Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- üîé CLIP  
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Segment Anything (SAM)  
- ‚ûï And many more

## ü™§ Why Fondant?

Foundation models simplify inference by solving multiple tasks across modalities with a simple
prompt-based interface. But what they've gained in the front, they've lost in the back. 
**These models require enormous amounts of data, moving complexity towards data preparation**, and 
leaving few parties able to train their own models.

We believe that **innovation is a group effort**, requiring collaboration. While the community has 
been building and sharing models, everyone is still building their data preparation from scratch.
**Fondant is the platform where we meet to build and share data preparation workflows.**

Fondant offers a framework to build **composable data preparation pipelines, with reusable 
components, optimized to handle massive datasets**. Stop building from scratch, and start 
reusing components to:
- Extend your data with public datasets
- Generate new modalities using captioning, segmentation, translation, image generation, ...
- Distill knowledge from existing foundation models
- Filter out low quality data
- Deduplicate data

And create high quality datasets to fine-tune your own foundation models.

## ü™Ñ Example pipelines

Curious to see what Fondant can do? Have a look at our example pipelines:

### Fine-tuning ControlNet

Our 
[example pipeline to generate data for ControlNet fine-tuning](examples/pipelines/controlnet-interior-design) 
allows you to create models that you can control using inpainting, segmentation, and 
regeneration. All you need to get started is a set of prompts describing the type of images to 
generate.

For instance, using our ControlNet model fine-tuned on interior design images, allows you to 
generate the room of your dreams:

| Input image                                                    | Output image                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![input image](docs/art/interior_design_controlnet_input1.png) | ![output image](docs/art/interior_design_controlnet_output1.jpg) |

Want to try out the resulting model yourself, head over to our 
[Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ml6team/controlnet-interior-design)!

### Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion (:construction:)

Using our 
[example pipeline to fine-tune Stable Diffusion](examples/pipelines/finetune_stable_diffusion) 
allows you to create models that generate better images within a specific domain. All you need to 
get started is a small seed dataset of example images.

Eg. generating logos:

| Stable Diffusion 1.5                                | Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion 1.5               |

## üß© Reusable components

Fondant comes with a library of reusable components, which can jumpstart your pipeline.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

Fondant can be installed using pip:

```
pip install fondant
```

For the latest development version, you might want to install from source instead:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ml6team/fondant.git
```

### üß± Deploying Fondant

Fondant is flexible and works by leveraging [kubeflow pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v1/introduction/) on any kubernetes cluster. All fondant needs is an url pointing to the kubeflow pipeline host and a Object Storage provider (S3, GCS, etc) to store data produced in the pipeline between steps.

We have compiled some references and created some scripts to [get you started](https://fondant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/infrastructure) with setting up the required infrastructure.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

#### Pipeline

Fondant allows you to easily define data pipelines comprised of both reusable and custom 
components. The following pipeline for instance uses the reusable `load_from_hf_hub` component 
to load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub and process it using a custom component:


```python
from fondant.pipeline import ComponentOp, Pipeline, Client


def build_pipeline():
    pipeline = Pipeline(pipeline_name="example pipeline", base_path="fs://bucket")

    load_from_hub_op = ComponentOp.from_registry(
        name="load_from_hf_hub",
        arguments={"dataset_name": "lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions"},
    )
    pipeline.add_op(load_from_hub_op)

    custom_op = ComponentOp(
        component_spec_path="components/custom_component/fondant_component.yaml",
        arguments={
            "min_width": 600,
            "min_height": 600,
        },
    )
    pipeline.add_op(custom_op, dependencies=load_from_hub_op)

    return pipeline
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = Client(host="https://kfp-host.com/")
    pipeline = build_pipeline()
    client.compile_and_run(pipeline=pipeline)
```

#### Component

To create a custom component, you first need to describe its contract as a yaml specification. 
It defines the data consumed and produced by the component and any arguments it takes.

```yaml
name: Custom component
description: This is a custom component
image: custom_component:latest

consumes:
  images:
    fields:
      data:
        type: binary

produces:
  captions:
    fields:
      data:
        type: utf8

args:
  argument1:
    description: An argument passed to the component at runtime
    type: str
  argument2:
    description: Another argument passed to the component at runtime
    type: str
```

Once you have your component specification, all you need to do is implement a single `.transform` 
method and Fondant will do the rest. You will get the data defined in your specification as a 
[Dask](https://www.dask.org/) dataframe, which is evaluated lazily.

```python
from fondant.component import TransformComponent

class ExampleComponent(TransformComponent):

    def transform(self, dataframe, *, argument1, argument2):
        """Implement your custom logic in this single method
        
        Args:
            dataframe: A Dask dataframe containing the data
            argumentX: An argument passed to the component
        """
```

## üöß Current state and roadmap

Fondant is currently in the alpha stage, offering a minimal viable interface. While you should 
expect to run into rough edges, the foundations are ready and Fondant should already be able to 
speed up your data preparation work.

**The following topics are on our roadmap**
- Local pipeline execution
- Non-linear pipeline DAGs
- LLM-focused example pipelines and reusable components
- Static validation, caching, and partial execution of pipelines
- Data lineage and experiment tracking
- Distributed execution, both on and off cluster
- Support other dataframe libraries such as HF Datasets, Polars, Spark
- Move reusable components into a decentralized component registry
- Create datasets of copy-right free data for fine-tuning
- Create reusable components for bias detection and mitigation

The roadmap and priority are defined based on community feedback. To provide input, you can join 
[our discord](https://discord.gg/HnTdWhydGp) or submit an idea in our 
[Github Discussions](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/discussions/categories/ideas).

For a detailed view on the roadmap and day to day development, you can check our [github project 
board](https://github.com/orgs/ml6team/projects/1).
